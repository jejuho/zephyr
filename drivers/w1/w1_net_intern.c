/* @brief searches bus for next device
 *
 * This function searches the next 1-wire device on the bus.
 * It sets the found rom and the last discrepancy in case more than one
 * device took part in the search.
 * In case only one device took part in the search, the discrepancy is set to
 * W1_SEARCH_LAST_DEVICE, and in case no device participated in the search,
 * the discrepancy is set to W1_SEARCH_NO_DEVICE.
 *
 * The Implementation is similar as suggested in the maxim application note 187.
 * The controller reads the first rom bit and its complementary value of all
 * devices.
 * Due to physical characteristics, the value received is a
 * logical AND of all devices 1st bit. Devices only continue to participate
 * in the search procedure if the next bit the controller sends matches their
 * own addresses bit. This allows the controller to branch through 64-bit
 * addresses in order to detect all devices.

 * The 1st bit received is stored in bit 1 of rom_inv_64, the 2nd in bit 2 and so
 * on until bit 64.
 * As a result each byte of the rom has the correct bit order, but the received
 * bytes (big-endian) stored in rom_inv_64 are in inverse byte order.
 *
 * Note: Filtering on families is not supported.
 *
 * @param dev              Pointer to the device structure for the w1 instance.
 * @param command          Command to chose between normal and alarm search.
 * @param family           The family is ignored in search.
 * @param last_discrepancy This must be set to W1_SEARCH_DISCREPANCY_INIT before
 *                         the first call, it carries the search progress for
 *                         further calls.
 * @param rom_inv_64       The found rom: It must be set to zero before first
 *                         call and carries the last found rom for furter calls.
 *                         The rom is stored in inverse byte order.
